    <h2>Use of Chips</h2>
    
    <h3>Overview of Chips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chips are special game elements designed to enhance player engagement and introduce additional strategic layers to the game. Players have access to three unique chips, each with its distinct impact on gameplay:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wildcard</strong>
                <li><strong>Triple Captain</strong>
                <li><strong>Bench Boost</strong>
            </ul>
        <li>You will be asked for confirmation before activating a chip</li>
        <li>Once a chip is activated, it will remain in effect for that Gameweek and is final and cannot be undone.</li>
        <li>Each chip can be utilized only once per season. Once activated, the effect of the chip is irreversible and cannot be undone for the remainder of the season.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chip Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows for unlimited transfers in a single Gameweek without any point penalties.</li>
                <li>Must be used in the same Gameweek once activated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Triple Captain:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Enables players to triple the points scored by their nominated captain for a single Gameweek.</li>
                <li>Replaces the standard double points awarded to a captain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bench Boost:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows all 6 players in a squad to score points in a single Gameweek.</li>
                <li>Beneficial as typically only 5 playersâ€™ scores are counted, with the remaining four left on the bench.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
